I manage most of my code/documents on my local home directory and I do not note when I make changes, or where some things are stored. This leads me to believe I have bad reproducibility, as I may not update everything correctly. I think it is vital in bioinformatics to have reproducibility, as it is often a collaborative effort that requires things to be up-to-date and noted as such. I plan to go into genetic research, meaning I will be dealing with data sets, and this will require similar needs.
