Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study
I don't currently manage my documents and code, but I am learning how to. I have yet to publish any work, but I have worked on README files in github. I am trying to comment my code well so that it can be reproducible. Nonreproducible research probably does not add much to the world of computational biology. If all biologists made their work reproducible, it would be helpful for all biologists to have access to other work. In my specific field of study of genetics, reproducible research would be very helpful. Especially code like we worked on today of making the reverse compliment of sequences.
