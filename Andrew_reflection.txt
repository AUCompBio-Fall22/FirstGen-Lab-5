Up to this point in the class, my management of documents and code has been all local to the virtual machine. Whenever I go in to work on things or make edits I haven't really kept detailed notes of changes and such. This method would not stand up to a reproducibility test because I haven't taken the effort to make it reproducible. Non-reproducible research is probably very difficult to work with in computational biology and bioinformatics because it makes it incredible difficult to verify a person's research or to apply their method to a similar use. My major is genetics, so reproducible work dealing with bioinformatics is very important for working many different sequences and sharing findings to other researchers in genetics/bioinformatics.
